CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN TENETS AND GUARDRAILS - Revised the wording slightly.\nARTICLE II. COMMUNITY AND GOVERNANCE - \n-The expression has been simplified.\n-Regarding Treasury Withdrawal requirements, we have removed the Budget requirement and added the Roadmap requirement.\n-Added a provision allowing for limited implementation of execute functionality for treasury withdrawals (ARTICLE II Section 5 Requirement 7)\n-We have removed clauses that are no longer in operation, such as the DRep and SPO Code of Conduct.\nARTICLE III. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE - Revised the wording slightly.\nAPPENDIX I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS\n-The terms have been defined in more detail.\n-Misspellings and inaccuracies have been corrected.\n-Regarding Treasury Withdrawal requirements, we have removed the Budget requirement and added the Roadmap requirement.\nAPPENDIX II. SUPPORTING GUIDANCE - Revised the wording slightly.",
    "motivation": "The current Constitution has the following six problems:\n1) There are typos and inconsistencies in spelling.\n2) There are many redundant expressions.\n3) Definitions are not clear.\n4) There are provisions that are not implemented in many cases, such as the DRep and SPO codes of conduct.\n5) An unnecessary requirement, a budget process, is defined for treasury withdrawals, and necessary requirements such as setting a roadmap are not defined. \n6) The current constitution does not have an execute function. DRep is limited in its ability to handle everything related to treasury withdrawals.",
    "rationale": "We have addressed the six issues described in the \"Motivation\" section as follows:\n1) We corrected typos and inconsistencies in spelling.\n2) We simplified the structure and significantly reduced the number of words.\n3) We clarified definitions.\n4) We deleted provisions that are not used in many cases, such as the DRep and SPO codes of conduct.\n5) We deleted the unnecessary requirement of a budget process for treasury withdrawals and defined necessary requirements, such as setting a roadmap.\n6) Added a clause to allow limited implementation of execute functionality as a requirement for treasury withdrawals (ARTICLE II Section 5 Requirement 7) For example, the executive function of Cardano marketing can be established by 67% of the DRep agreeing to an information action stating that \"marketing-type governance actions require prior approval by the Cardano Marketing Committee body.\" This allows the DRep to give the \"Cardano Marketing Committee\" the authority and responsibility to pre-investigate, coordinate, and approve any treasury withdrawal related to marketing, and can enforce this by having the Constitution Committee reject any treasury withdrawal governance action that does not meet this requirement.",
