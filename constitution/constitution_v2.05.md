# CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN ECOSYSTEM CONSTITUTION
## PREAMBLE
Cardano is a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance, committed to improving economic, political, and social systems for everyone, everywhere. By offering this foundational infrastructure, Cardano empowers individuals and communities to manage their identity, value and governance, fostering the emergence of decentralized applications, businesses and network states.
Through unbiased processing of immutable data, we, the participants of the Cardano Community, consisting of individuals, organizations, contributors and others, choose to follow in the footsteps of the early Internet and cryptocurrency pioneers, who first forged bonds of community through digital technologies. We are guided by our shared principles and tenets as we exercise our self-governance by balancing decentralized decision-making with accountability and safeguarding the security of the Cardano Blockchain.
Recognizing the need for a more robust and dynamic governance framework, that neither relies nor depends upon traditional nation-state governance systems, but instead relies on self-governance by the Cardano Community, utilizing, wherever possible and beneficial, blockchain technology in the governance process, we hereby establish this Cardano Constitution to govern the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem, ensure the continuity of the Cardano Blockchain, and guard the rights of those who utilize it and the rights of those who own ada.
With these purposes in mind, we, the Cardano Community, affirm our intention to abide by this Constitution in order to participate in the governance of the Cardano Blockchain ecosystem. We invite all who share our values to join us for as long as they wish, while honoring the freedom to take another path.

Treasury Withdrawal Recipients shall use treasury withdrawals for the purpose set out in Section 7, paragraph 1 above.
## ARTICLE III. CONSTITUTIONAL COMMITTEE
### Section 1 Role and Scope
A CC shall be established as the branch of Cardano's on-chain governance process that ensures governance actions to be enacted on-chain are consistent with this Constitution.
Each CC member shall have one vote.
No governance action—other than a “No Confidence” or “Update Committee” action—may be implemented on-chain without affirmation by a requisite percentage of CC members.
TheCC shall be limited to voting on the constitutionality of governance actions, including any proposed or contemplated actions contained within Info actions.
### Section 2 Composition and Terms
The CC shall be composed of such number of members and serve such term lengths as are sufficient to assure the ongoing integrity of the Cardano Blockchain, as determined from time to time by owners of ada.
To assure continuity in the operation of the CC, the terms for CC members shall be staggered.
### Section 3 Election Process, No Confidence and Removal
The CC shall be considered to be in one of the following two states at all times: a state of confidence or a state of no confidence. In a state of no confidence, members of the then standing CC must be reinstated or replaced using the “Update Committee” action before any other on-chain governance action, other than "Info" actions, may go forward. If a “No Confidence” action is enacted, a state of no confidence will result.
The Cardano Community shall establish and make public a process from time to time for election of members of the CC consistent with the requirements of the Guardrails.
In the event of a vote of no confidence or the removal of some CC members by “Update Committee” action, an election shall be held as soon as practical.

When voting that a governance action proposed to be executed on-chain is unconstitutional, each CC member casting such a vote shall set forth the basis for its decision with reference to specific Articles of this Constitution or provisions of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix that are in conflict with a given proposal.
CC members may be compensated for their efforts as members and shall ensure that any compensation received in connection with such activities is disclosed in a timely manner through relevant governance communication channels.
## ARTICLE IV. AMENDMENT PROCESS
### Section 1 Amendment Rules
Amendments to this Constitution, including amendments to the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix, shall require approval through a collective decision-making process, by means of an on-chain governance action supported by at least 65% of the then active voting stake, unless a different threshold is specifically set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails Appendix for the amendment of a particular Guardrail, in which case that specified threshold shall apply.
## APPENDIX I. CARDANO BLOCKCHAIN GUARDRAILS
### 1. Introduction
To implement Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance, it is necessary to establish sensible Guardrails that will enable the Cardano Blockchain to continue to operate in a secure and sustainable way.
This Appendix sets forth Guardrails that must be applied to Cardano Blockchain on-chain governance actions, including changes to the protocol parameters and limits on treasury withdrawals. These Guardrails cover both essential, intrinsic limits on settings, and recommendations that are based on experience, research, measurement and governance objectives.
These Guardrails are designed to avoid both unexpected and foreseeable problems with the operation of the Cardano Blockchain. They are intended to guide the choice of sensible parameter settings and avoid potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability. As described below, some of these Guardrails are automatable and will be enforced via an on-chain Guardrails Script or built-in ledger rules.
These Guardrails apply only to the Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 mainnet environment. They are not intended to apply to test environments or to other blockchains that use Cardano Blockchain software.
Not all parameters for the Cardano Blockchain can be considered independently. Some parameters interact with other settings in an intrinsic way. Where known, these interactions are addressed in this Appendix.
While the Guardrails in this Appendix presently reflect the current state of technical insight, this Appendix should be treated as a living document. Implementation improvements, new simulations or performance evaluation results for the Cardano Blockchain may allow some of the restrictions contained in these Guardrails to be relaxed or tightened in due course.
Additional Guardrails may also be needed where, for example, new protocol parameters are introduced or existing ones are removed.
#### Amending, Adding or Deprecating Guardrails
The Guardrails set forth in this Appendix may be amended from time to time pursuant to an on-chain governance action that satisfies the applicable voting threshold as set forth in this Appendix. Any such amendment to any Guardrails shall require and be deemed to be an amendment to the Constitution itself, including any new Guardrails. Each Guardrail has a unique label. If the text of a Guardrail is amended, the existing Guardrail will be deprecated and a new label will be used in this Appendix. Similarly, if a Guardrail is deprecated, its label will never be reused in the future. In all cases, the Guardrails that apply to a governance action will be those in force at the time that the governance action is submitted on-chain, regardless of any later amendments.
#### Terminology and Guidance
This section provides supplementary definitions and interpretive guidance for terms used throughout this Constitution and the Guardrails Appendix.
Cardano Blockchain. The decentralized, public, peer-to-peer, proof-of-stake distributed ledger system, designed to securely record, verify, and synchronize transactions and data across the network while enabling the execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications. This system, powered by ada, is the longest chain of Blocks with sufficient confirmations to be considered finalized starting from Block Hash 5f20df933584822601f9e3f8c024eb5eb252fe8cefb24d1317dc3d432e940ebb, as forged on 2017-09-23 21:44:51 UTC on the Cardano Network.
Block. A container of data produced by a Stake Pool that includes, at minimum, a header. Block production and Block forging are used interchangeably.
Protocol. The algorithms, rules, and procedures that govern the exchange of information on the Cardano Blockchain.
Protocol Parameters. Protocol settings that define how the Cardano Blockchain functions; modifiable through applicable governance processes.
Slot. The smallest denomination of time nested within an Epoch.
Epoch. A Protocol-determined interval characterized by a fixed number of Slots. Each Slot's duration and sequence are governed by the blockchain's consensus mechanisms and are associated with a universal timestamp defined in UTC. It is used for operations including governance voting, Block production leadership determination, rewards calculation, and Hard Forks.
lovelace. The smallest unit of value for the native cryptocurrency of the Cardano Blockchain, utilized for the network’s security and governance. It is distinguished from other native tokens by its lack of a policy ID and policy name.
ada. A superunit of lovelace, with 1 ada equal to 1,000,000 lovelace.
Delegator. A private key holder that delegates stake to a Stake Pool for Block production and network security, to a DRep for participation in on-chain governance, or both. In doing so, the delegator contributes to the operation and governance of the Cardano Blockchain.
Active Block Production Stake. The cumulative amount of stake, measured in lovelace, that is actively delegated to Stake Pools and utilized for Block forging during the current Epoch. This amount is determined by a snapshot of stake distribution taken at the beginning of the previous Epoch, ensuring that it accurately represents the effective stake available for securing and maintaining the Cardano Blockchain through Block forging.
On-chain. A classification for actions, transactions, or governance activities that are executed, recorded, or implemented directly on the Cardano Blockchain. These actions, transactions, or governance activities are permanently validated and stored through the blockchain’s consensus mechanism, ensuring their immutability and transparency.
Off-Chain. A classification for activities, proposals, or governance decisions that are either not yet implemented on the Cardano Blockchain, or not intended to be directly recorded on the blockchain. These may include discussions, proposals, or agreements that exist outside the blockchain and do not involve direct consensus or on-chain validation.
Governance Action. An on-chain proposal enabling participation in shaping the future of the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem through voting transactions.
Hard Fork. A Protocol upgrade for the Cardano Blockchain that results in a new Protocol version and necessitates coordinated adoption by network participants.
Guardrails. A set of restrictions on Governance Actions to prevent undesirable outcomes and assist voters in deciding whether the proposed action complies with the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution. Some guardrails are enforced using the Guardrails Script or ledger rules to prevent submission of the action, while others necessitate further adjudication to determine if they violate the Constitution in ways the Guardrails Script or ledger cannot check. Guardrails may be either mandatory (“must”/“must not”) or advisory (“should”/“should not”). The latter allows for interpretive flexibility where necessary.
Guardrails Script. A smart contract script that checks specific proposed Governance Actions, Hard Fork and Parameter update Governance Actions, against automatically checkable Guardrails. The check is applied when the Governance Action is proposed on-chain.
Motion of no confidence governance action (“No Confidence” action). A motion to create a state of no confidence in the current constitutional committee.
Update committee and/or threshold and/or terms governance action (“Update Committee” action). Changes to the members of the constitutional committee and/or to its signature threshold and/or terms.
New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action (“New Constitution” action). A modification to the Constitution or Guardrails Script, recorded as on-chain hashes.
Hard Fork Initiation governance action (“Hard Fork Initiation” action). Triggers a non-backwards compatible upgrade of the network; requires a prior software upgrade.
Protocol Parameter Changes governance action (“Parameter Changes” action or “Parameter Update” action). Any change to one or more updatable protocol parameters, excluding changes to major protocol versions ("hard forks").
Treasury Withdrawals governance action (“Treasury Withdrawals” action). Withdrawals from the treasury.
Info action (“Info” action). An action that has no effect on-chain, other than an on-chain record.
Cardano Blockchain Treasury, Cardano Treasury, or Treasury. A supply of ada controlled by the Protocol of the Cardano Blockchain; collected from transaction fees, reserves, and other designated sources. Withdrawals from this supply of ada are subject to the processes and restrictions set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.
Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem. The collective ecosystem comprising the Cardano Blockchain, the Cardano Community, and the tooling and infrastructure utilized by the Cardano Community to support the Cardano Blockchain in alignment with the shared principles and objectives set forth in the Cardano Blockchain Ecosystem Constitution.
Expected. A reasonable presumption that the identified action, although not mandatory, will occur.
Should/Should not. Where this Appendix says that a value "should not" be set below or above some value, this means that the Guardrail is a recommendation or guideline, and the specific value could be open to discussion or alteration by a suitably expert group recognized by the Cardano Community in light of experience with the Cardano Blockchain governance system or the operation of the Cardano Blockchain.
Must/Must not. Where this Appendix says that a value "must" or "must not" be set below or above some value, this means that the Guardrail is a requirement that will be enforced by Cardano Blockchain ledger rules, types or other built-in mechanisms where possible, and that if not followed could cause a protocol failure, security breach or other undesirable outcome.
Benchmarking. Benchmarking refers to careful system level performance evaluation that is designed to show a priori that, for example, 95% of blocks will be diffused across a global network of Cardano Blockchain nodes within the required 5s time interval in all cases. This may require construction of specific test workflows and execution on a large test network of Cardano Blockchain nodes, simulating a global Cardano Blockchain network.
Performance analysis. Performance analysis refers to projecting theoretical performance, empirical benchmarking or simulation results to predict actual system behavior. For example, performance results obtained from tests in a controlled test environment (such as a collection of data centers with known networking properties) may be extrapolated to inform likely performance behavior in a real Cardano Blockchain network environment.
Simulation. Simulation refers to synthetic execution that is designed to inform performance/functionality decisions in a repeatable way. For example, the IOSim Cardano Blockchain module allows the operation of the networking stack to be simulated in a controlled and repeatable way, allowing issues to be detected before code deployment.
Performance Monitoring. Performance monitoring involves measuring the actual behavior of the Cardano Blockchain network, for example, by using timing probes to evaluate round-trip times, or test blocks to assess overall network health. It complements benchmarking and performance analysis by providing information about actual system behavior that cannot be obtained using simulated workloads or theoretical analysis.
Reverting Changes. Where performance monitoring shows that actual network behavior following a change is inconsistent with the performance requirements for the Cardano Blockchain, then the change must be reverted to its previous state if that is possible. For example, if the block size is increased from 100KB to 120KB and 95% of blocks are no longer diffused within 5s, then a change must be made to revert the block size to 100KB. If this is not possible, then one or more alternative changes must be made that will ensure that the performance requirements are met.
Severity Levels. Issues that affect the Cardano Blockchain network are classified by severity level, where:
Severity 1 is a critical incident or issue with very high impact to the security, performance, functionality or sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network
Severity 2 is a major incident or issue with significant impact to the security, performance, functionality or sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network
Severity 3 is a minor incident or issue with low impact to the security, performance, functionality or sustainability of the Cardano Blockchain network
Future Performance Requirements. Planned development such as new mechanisms for out of memory storage may impact block diffusion or other times. When changing parameters, it is necessary to consider these future performance requirements as well as the current operation of the Cardano Blockchain. Until development is complete, the requirements will be conservative but may then be relaxed to account for actual timing behavior.
#### Automated Checking ("Guardrails Script")
A script hash is associated with the Constitution hash when a New Constitution or Guardrails Script governance action is enacted. It acts as an additional safeguard to the ledger rules and types, filtering non-compliant governance actions.
The Guardrails Script only affects two types of governance actions:
"Parameter Update" actions, and
"Treasury Withdrawal" actions.
The Guardrails Script is executed when either of these types of governance action is submitted on-chain. This avoids scenarios where, for example, an erroneous script could prevent the Cardano Blockchain from ever enacting a Hard Fork action, resulting in deadlock. There are three different situations that apply to Guardrail Script usage.
Symbol and Explanation
(y) The Guardrail Script can be used to enforce the Guardrail
(x) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail
(~ - reason) The Guardrail Script cannot be used to enforce the Guardrail for the reason given, but future ledger changes could enable this.
Guardrails may overlap: in this case, the most restrictive set of Guardrails will apply.
Where a parameter is not explicitly listed in this document, then the Guardrail Script must not permit any changes to the parameter.
Conversely, where a parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable Guardrails are specified, the Guardrail Script must not impose any constraints on changes to the parameter.
### 2. Guardrails and Guidelines on "Parameter Update" actions
Below are Guardrails and guidelines for changing updatable protocol parameter settings via the "Parameter Update" action such that the Cardano Blockchain is never in an unrecoverable state as a result of such changes.
Note that, to avoid ambiguity, this Appendix uses the parameter name that is used in "Parameter Update" actions rather than any other convention.
##### GUARDRAILS
PARAM-01 (y) Any protocol parameter that is not explicitly named in this document must not be changed by a "Parameter Update" action
PARAM-02a (y) Where a protocol parameter is explicitly listed in this document but no checkable Guardrails are specified, the Guardrails Script must not impose any constraints on changes to the parameter. Checkable Guardrails are shown by a (y)
### 2.1. Critical Protocol Parameters
The below protocol parameters are critical from a security point of view.
#### Parameters that are Critical to the Operation of the Blockchain
maximum block body size (maxBlockBodySize)
maximum transaction size (maxTxSize)
maximum block header size (maxBlockHeaderSize)
maximum size of a serialized asset value (maxValueSize)
maximum script execution/memory units in a single block (maxBlockExecutionUnits[steps/memory])
minimum fee coefficient (txFeePerByte)
minimum fee constant (txFeeFixed)
minimum fee per byte for reference scripts (minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte)
minimum lovelace deposit per byte of serialized UTxO (utxoCostPerByte)
governance action deposit (govDeposit)
##### GUARDRAILS
PARAM-03a (y) A parameter that is critical to the operation of the blockchain require an SPO vote in addition to a DRep vote: SPOs must say "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active block production stake. This is enforced by the Guardrails on the stake pool voting threshold.
PARAM-04a (x) At least 90 days should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to the operation of the blockchain and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.
#### Parameters that are Critical to the Governance System
delegation key lovelace deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)
pool registration lovelace deposit (stakePoolDeposit)
minimum fixed rewards cut for pools (minPoolCost)
DRep deposit amount (dRepDeposit)
minimal Constitutional Committee size (committeeMinSize)
maximum term length (in epochs) for the Constitutional Committee members (committeeMaxTermLength)
##### GUARDRAILS
PARAM-05a (y) DReps must vote "yes" with a collective support of more than 50% of all active voting stake. This is enforced by the Guardrails on the DRep voting thresholds.
PARAM-06a (x) At least 90 days should normally pass between the publication of an off-chain proposal to change a parameter that is critical to the governance system and the submission of the corresponding on-chain governance action. This Guardrail may be relaxed in the event of a Severity 1 or Severity 2 network issue following careful technical discussion and evaluation.
### 2.2. Economic Parameters
The overall goals when managing economic parameters are to:
Enable long-term economic sustainability for the Cardano Blockchain;
Ensure that stake pools are adequately rewarded for maintaining the Cardano Blockchain;
Ensure that ada holders are adequately rewarded for using stake in constructive ways, including when delegating ada for block production; and
Balance economic incentives for different Cardano Blockchain ecosystem stakeholders, including but not limited to Stake Pool Operators, ada holders, DeFi users, infrastructure users, developers (e.g. DApps) and financial intermediaries (e.g. exchanges)
#### Triggers for Change
Significant changes in the fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability
Changes in transaction volumes or types
Community requests or suggestions
Emergency situations that require changes to economic parameters
#### Counter-indicators
Changes to the economic parameters should not be made in isolation. They need to account for:
External economic factors
Network security concerns
#### Core Metrics
Fiat value of ada resulting in potential problems with security, performance, functionality or long-term sustainability
Transaction volumes and types
Number and health of stake pools
External economic factors
#### Changes to Specific Economic Parameters
Transaction fee per byte (txFeePerByte) and fixed transaction fee (txFeeFixed)
Defines the cost for basic transactions in lovelace:
fee(tx) = txFeeFixed + txFeePerByte x nBytes(tx)
##### GUARDRAILS
TFPB-01 (y) txFeePerByte must not be lower than 30 (0.000030 ada) This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks
TFPB-02 (y) txFeePerByte must not exceed 1,000 (0.001 ada) This ensures that transactions can be paid for
TFPB-03 (y) txFeePerByte must not be negative
TFF-01 (y) txFeeFixed must not be lower than 100,000 (0.1 ada) This protects against low-cost denial of service attacks
TFF-02 (y) txFeeFixed must not exceed 10,000,000 (10 ada) This ensures that transactions can be paid for
TFF-03 (y) txFeeFixed must not be negative
TFGEN-01 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, txFeeFixed and txFeePerByte should be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (executionUnitPrices[steps/memory])
TFGEN-02 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to txFeeFixed or txFeePerByte must consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee so that it becomes impossible to construct a transaction.
#### UTxO cost per byte (utxoCostPerByte)
Defines the deposit (in lovelace) that is charged for each byte of storage that is held in a UTxO. This deposit is returned when the UTxO is no longer active.
Sets a minimum threshold on ada that is held within a single UTxO
Provides protection against low-cost denial of service attack on UTxO storage. DoS protection decreases in line with the free node memory (proportional to UTxO growth)
Helps reduce long-term storage costs for node users by providing an incentive to return UTxOs when no longer needed, or to merge UTxOs.
##### GUARDRAILS
UCPB-01 (y) utxoCostPerByte must not be lower than 3,000 (0.003 ada)
UCPB-02 (y) utxoCostPerByte must not exceed 6,500 (0.0065 ada)
UCPB-03 (y) utxoCostPerByte must not be zero
UCPB-04 (y) utxoCostPerByte must not be negative
UCPB-05a (x - "should") Changes should account for
The acceptable cost of attack
The acceptable time for an attack
The acceptable memory configuration for full node users
The sizes of UTxOs and
The current total node memory usage
#### Stake address deposit (stakeAddressDeposit)
Ensures that stake addresses are retired when no longer needed
Helps reduce long-term storage costs
Helps limit CPU and memory costs in the ledger
The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Reducing the number of active stake addresses also reduces processing and memory costs at the epoch boundary when calculating stake snapshots.
##### GUARDRAILS
SAD-01 (y) stakeAddressDeposit must not be lower than 1,000,000 (1 ada)
SAD-02 (y) stakeAddressDeposit must not exceed 5,000,000 (5 ada)
SAD-03 (y) stakeAddressDeposit must not be negative
#### Stake pool deposit (stakePoolDeposit)
Ensures that stake pools are retired by the stake pool operator when no longer needed by them
Helps reduce long-term storage costs
The rationale for the deposit is to incentivize that scarce memory resources are returned when they are no longer required. Rewards and stake snapshot calculations are also impacted by the number of active stake pools.
##### GUARDRAILS
SPD-01 (y) stakePoolDeposit must not be lower than 250,000,000 (250 ada)
SPD-02 (y) stakePoolDeposit must not exceed 500,000,000 (500 ada)
SPD-03 (y) stakePoolDeposit must not be negative
#### Minimum Pool Cost (minPoolCost)
Part of the rewards mechanism
The minimum pool cost is transferred to the pool rewards address before any delegator rewards are paid
##### GUARDRAILS

the cost of executing a transaction with maximum memory units is similar to the cost of a maximum sized non-script transaction
EIUP-GEN-02 (x - "should") The execution prices should be adjusted whenever transaction fees are adjusted (txFeeFixed/txFeePerByte). The goal is to ensure that the processing delay is similar for "full" transactions, regardless of their type.
This helps ensure that the requirements on block diffusion/propagation times are met.

MFRS-02 (y) minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte must not be negative
MFRS-03 (x - "should") To maintain a consistent level of protection against denial-of-service attacks, minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte should be adjusted whenever Plutus Execution prices are adjusted (executionUnitPrices[steps/memory]) and whenever txFeeFixed is adjusted
MFRS-04 (x - unquantifiable) Any changes to minFeeRefScriptCoinsPerByte must consider the implications of reducing the cost of a denial-of-service attack or increasing the maximum transaction fee
### 2.3. Network Parameters
The overall goals when managing the Cardano Blockchain network parameters are to:
Match the available Cardano Blockchain Layer 1 network capacity to current or future traffic demands, including payment transactions, layer 1 DApps, sidechain management and governance needs
Balance traffic demands for different user groups, including payment transactions, minters of Fungible/Non-Fungible Tokens, Plutus scripts, DeFi developers, Stake Pool Operators and voting transactions
#### Triggers for Change

Anticipated changes in traffic demands
Cardano Community requests
#### Counter-indicators
Changes may need to be reversed and/or should not be enacted in the event of:
Excessive block propagation delays
Stake pools being unable to handle traffic volume
Scripts being unable to complete execution
#### Core Metrics
All decisions on parameter changes should be informed by:
Block propagation delay profile
Traffic volume (block size over time)
Script volume (size of scripts and execution units)
Script execution cost benchmarks
Block propagation delay/diffusion benchmarks
Detailed benchmarking results are required to confirm the effect of any changes on mainnet performance or behavior prior to enactment. The effects of different transaction mixes must be analyzed, including normal transactions, Plutus scripts, and governance actions.

Any increase must also consider previously identified future requirements for the total block size (maxBlockBodySize) measured against the total block diffusion target of 3s with 95% block propagation within 5s. Future Plutus performance improvements may allow the per-block step limit to be increased, but must be balanced against the overall diffusion limits as specified in the previous sentence, and future requirements

## APPENDIX II. SUPPORTING GUIDANCE
This Appendix II is intended to provide guidance in interpreting the Constitution and the Constitutional Committee shall consider this Appendix II as it deems relevant and useful in carrying out its constitutional duties.
### 1. Framing Notes
The Cardano Blockchain was established in 2017. In July 2020 the Cardano Blockchain was expanded to include independent block validators and in September 2024 an on-chain governance system was introduced. This Constitution outlines the rights and responsibilities of governance actors in the decentralized system who represent the owners of ada, the governance token of the Cardano Blockchain. The Cardano Blockchain is a decentralized ecosystem of blockchain technology, smart contracts, and community governance.
In approaching this Constitution, the Cardano Community recognizes that this is not a constitution for only a blockchain but rather a constitution for a blockchain ecosystem. Accordingly, how governance actions are approved, while extremely important, is not the sole focus of this Constitution. Rather, this Constitution provides the basis and fundamental framework through which all participants in the Cardano Community can come together to govern themselves and form new approaches to human interaction and collaboration.
By necessity, this Constitution recognizes the role of and empowers the Constitutional Committee, confirms the right of the Cardano Community to participate in collective bodies for collaboration, gives effect to on-chain governance, and empowers DReps — including ada holders acting directly as DReps — to act as the voice of ada holders for on-chain voting.
The Constitution also recognizes the necessity of safeguarding access to and the use of funds of the Cardano Blockchain treasury through the inclusion of the Cardano Blockchain Guardrails in this Constitution.
### 2. Other Guidance
The drafters of the Constitution, together with other participants from the Cardano Community, have published and in the future may publish guidance for interpreting the Constitution, including, without limitation, a definition booklet that has been released contemporaneously with the on-chain ratification of the Constitution. So long as any such published guidance has been hashed to the Cardano Blockchain pursuant to an "Info" action, the Constitutional Committee shall not be precluded from considering and utilizing such guidance as it deems appropriate.
